# PML-Prediction_Assigment_WriteUp

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

In this project, I used data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. 
 
This repository contains the ActivityRecognition.Rmd file describing how I built model, how I used cross validation, what I think the expected out of sample error is, 
and why I made the choices. I used the prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
